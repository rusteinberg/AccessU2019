It comes in many shapes and colors, runs with different JavaScript libraries. There weren’t enough developers, QA testers, accessibility specialists, and designers in my previous organization to code, implement, and maintain all the date picker flavors, yet that’s exactly what we attempted to deal with. And although our small but dedicated accessibility team dealt with these one by one, it was an ongoing challenge. And that was only the date pickers that we knew of. There were sites and apps we never saw—some were rogue, some were abandon ware.  And this is just for the Date Picker—there were many other user interface components.</p>

As UX designer Russ Weakley points out, one of the downsides of a framework like Bootstrap is that it allows developers to code something as simple a button several ways. The Bootstrap button classes allow developers to make any element appear like a button even if these elements have no semantic meaning. Fake buttons might get announced as “buttons” by a screen reader but sometimes are not actionable. There are other issues too—like not having semantically coded headings that fall into a hierarchy, Sometimes developers only focus on the visual impact. Styling a span as a heading level 1 is not going to help assistive technology users.</p>

The important thing is once your team is assembled, you can begin to work out the details for creating what is called a design system.</p>

Some are documented better than others—and we’ll get to some of the details later on what I think makes a good design system. I am biased because I think the place I work, Wells Fargo, has a really great mix of talent and documentation—unfortunately, it’s behind a firewall.  But later on, I’ll explain a little but about our methodology without giving away any company secrets. But one of the things that impressed me most about Wells Fargo—and continues to impress me—is they’ve built accessibility into their design system. We have a component library that discusses look and feel, content, and accessibility with hopes that when developers build our apps they can just pluck user interface components that are already specked out and tested. Do they work with screen readers? How about responsive design?</p>

I hope my date picker example earlier helped explain how futile it can be when an organization tries to implement several flavors of the same thing with limited resources. There will always be that mentality among some who will say “But we’ve always done things that way.” To me it sounded like excuses. And worst of all, it helped make it very difficult to implement accessible sites and applications. Fortunately, I’m not the only one who hates hearing the same tired excuses especially when it comes to accessibility.</p>

The last aspect of a design system is the end-users who are actually using your product. Accessibility is another component of a design system. It doesn’t just apply to people who are blind or who are in wheelchairs. If you define accessibility only by these visible markers, you turn them into “others”—us vs. them.  Not very nice. She prefers the term inclusivity, which sounds more like it’s welcoming people. Your product is inclusive when it is most usable by the widest range of people, including but not limited to people with disabilities. Inclusivity can also include people with slow internet connections, older smart phones, old monitors, people with children in their hands.</p>

They embody the norms, values, and laws that every citizen tries to adhere to. Governments provide the foundation upon which great things happen. They attempt to solve universal needs so that people can go about their lives without thinking much about what it takes to keeps cities and towns running. At their best, governments work for all people. Design systems provide foundational elements like typography, grids, colors, standardized pieces of user interfaces, No matter where anyone is on your site, they know what a button looks like. Design systems are the perfect vehicle for your company’s accessibility efforts because they provide so much of the foundation upon which products are built. By weaving accessibility into the fabric of your system, your designers, engineers, all users will ultimately benefit.</p>

Practically speaking, don’t be novel for the sake of being novel. Following established pattern is how you make a product intuitive, how you make people feel like they already know how to use your product without ever reading instructions. This helps you lower the cognitive load someone needs to figure out how to use your product. This helps users who have cognitive or reading disabilities or just people in a rush. Design systems aren’t the place to try out experimental user interfaces. Make your links blue, put your nav in the same place. Don’t hide important functionality behind hover effects just for the sake of minimalism. Group like objects near each other.</p>
 
                                                                           <p>Semantics: As she puts it, accessible code is insanely important. If your code is not built for inclusivity, it almost doesn’t matter what your front end looks like. Use the correct code so that it’s readable by humans and machines. Write standards compliant semantic HTML and CSS, fill in with ARIA where appropriate, design for keyboard navigation. Designing and developing a logical keyboard navigation paradigm. Great keyboard control will make you a hero to people with accessibility needs AND power users alike.</p>
                                                                           <p>Color: Perceiving color is one of mankind’s superpowers, but not all of us see color in the same way or even at all. Using color alone to distinguish one thing from another thing is problematic for people who have difficulty perceiving color. But you can easily address this by adding labels, icons, explanations, or otherwise changing visual presentation. The color contrast rule is pretty often ignored by designers aspiring to “minimalism.” As product designers, we’re not designing for ourselves—we’re designing for our customers. If people can’t see your content, they can’t read it. And if they can’t read it, they’re probably not going to give you money. As WCAG says, don’t use color alone to convey information as the sole means and ensure good contrast.  One of the most common conventions is to underline a link and make it blue but there are designers who try to move away from this. One way around this is to add a caret after a link, changing the type weight or size, or you can make the underline thinner.</p>

To be reusable and scalable, patterns need to be modular, composable, generic, and flexible.</p>

Afterward, it needed further development to work for the whole Etsy application. Working in a silo with minimal outside feedback allowed us to make progress quickly, but meant that we had to work harder to encourage other teams to adopt the design system.</p>

The national used car retailer, CarMax, for example, has a design system that not only incorporates accessibility, but has a Legos team. Their goal is deliver a consistent user experience through a single source of brand styles for all product teams to use (colors, typography, icons); UI components (buttons, form elements, car tiles); and UX patterns (searching, completing a form, saving a car). The system is not only for consistency but for speed, as it allows product teams to build faster. And their design system also includes Typography, Color, Semantic HTML and ARIA, keyboard Navigation, and Focus Management</p>

                                                                           <p>Function defines things like structure, interaction design, and states.  Structurally buttons can have a text label, images/icons, or a combination of text and images/icons. Buttons might also contain a menu if they contain a down arrow icon. Buttons can be enabled, disabled, active/pressed. They have a focus state and a hover state. They should be reachable by keyboard or mouse. At certain breakpoints, a button may change in appearance. </p>
 
                                                                           <p>Appearance discusses different styles, dimensions, colors, padding, font, corner radius, padding, borders, opacity. What are the design rules? What are the colors - in all states</p>
 
                                                                           <p>Content discusses character limits, using active voice in how worded, consistency. Examples: Submit, Continue, Apply, Save. Can also include rules about alternative text or hidden text</p>
 
                                                                           <p>Accessibility includes rules that touch on the other specs. For example, in some sort of tabular data scenario, you might have button appear several times on one screen that says “View” and visually that makes sense in context, but behind the scenes the button may need to be announced by a screen reader as a “View Row 1” You must ensure the color scheme passes minimum color contrast ratio. You must ensure disabled state buttons are not focusable. You want to ensure responsive design works right for resizing text. You want to make sure whenever possible buttons use the &lt;button&gt; tag. You want to ensure aria is used if a button is a toggle button or aria-expanded is used if the button triggers a menu. Or if you have a help button that just contains a question mark that it has an aria label.. So accessibility would address Is their a native HTML element for it?</p>
