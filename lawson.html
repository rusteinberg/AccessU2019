						<h2>Medical Model</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">defines disability in terms of biological impairments. Disability is viewed as a problem that is caused by diagnosed genetic disorders, disease, trauma, or other health conditions. Disability is treated as a biological problem that diminishes quality of life and needs to be treated with professional medical care.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Social Model</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">Rather than place the definition of "disability" entirely on the person with a disability, this model points out that society creates disabling conditions. To a large extent, "disability" is an avoidable condition caused by poor design.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-doesn't deny that there is a biological or medical component to disability. It merely points out that more inclusive designs  can remove the barriers that people with disabilities face in their everyday lives. The model emphasizes the human rights of people with disabilities to participate in society in meaningful ways</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Functional Solutions Model</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">model takes a practical approach to disability by identifying the impairments, or limitations, that are a result of disability. The model then seeks out solutions for eradicating these limitations through advancements in technology or methodology. There is less of a focus on the social and political aspects of disability, but more focus on applying innovation to overcoming the limitations of disability.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Businesses that create and sell accessibility solutions often take this approach. They see a need and try to meet the need with their products and/or services.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Social Identity Model/Cultural Affiliation Model</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">People with disabilities may develop a sense of personal identity through consorting with others who share similar life experiences based on their disability. Together, the group develops a sense of culture based on these shared experiences.
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-doesn't always serve as a useful basis for technical definitions of disability, because groups of people with different types of disabilities—or even without any disabilities—may consider themselves part of the same social group.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Charity Model/Tragedy Model</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">treats disabilities as unfortunate or tragic conditions worthy of special treatment. People without disabilities take pity on those with disabilities and set up fundraisers, projects, assistance, and other interventions to improve the condition of those with disabilities.</p>	
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">Many people with disabilities find this approach offensive, even if the end result produces something that helps people with disabilities.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">With this approach, the offensive part is the attitude and the assumptions. People without disabilities are in the position of the givers; the "fortunate" ones. People with disabilities are in the position of the receivers; the "unfortunate" ones.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">This kind of arrangement sets up an unequal power balance, and an unhealthy social relationship between groups of people.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Blindness</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">A sightlessness or a loss of vision. While the term is often used to define a total loss of vision, it may also refer to partial blindness, where sight may be extremely limited (low vision)</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">	Causes: Diabetes, Macular Degeneration, Glaucoma, Accidents or traumatic injuries to the eye Stroke, Retinitis Pigmentosa</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Screen Readers</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">Convert the text on the web page into spoken words. Blind people listen to web pages</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>ICT Blindness Challenge: Cannot see digital or electronic interfaces (computers, automated teller machines (ATMs), mobile devices, airport kiosks, televisions, printers, copiers, phones, GPS devices, etc.)</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Screen readers can read interfaces and content out loud to users
						by converting digital text to synthesized speech, but only if they
						have been designed to be accessible. Screen readers do not
						announce text styles such as font, color, size, bold, and italic.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Self-voicing interfaces and applications can communicate to users
						without the need for a screen reader, but these are appropriate
						mostly for broadcasting information, because they usually do not
						interact with the interface or content as screen readers do.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Refreshable Braille output devices use screen readers to convert
						digital text to Braille. These devices are typically expensive, and
						only a minority of blind people know how to read Braille.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>ICT Blindness Challenge: Cannot use
						screen readers on digital content and
						interfaces not designed with
						accessibility in mind</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">Interface designers and content authors
						can edit the markup to make it
						compatible with the assistive
						technologies used by blind people.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Architecture & Built Environment
							Blindness Challenge: Cannot see when
							walking</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Canes help blind people feel their surroundings as they walk.
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Service animals (e.g. "Seeing Eye" dogs), trained to assist blind
						people, help them navigate their surroundings.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-GPS-based walking instructions with an audio interface, either
						automated or via a remote human navigator.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Raised tiles on the ground to indicate the edge of a platform,
						a pathway along a sidewalk, the beginning of a staircase, etc.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Eliminate low-hanging architectural features that a blind
						person could bump into</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Clear pathways without obstructions in hallways, sidewalks.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Architecture & Built Environment
							Blindness Challenge: Cannot see signs
							or other text on buildings or other
							areas in the built environment</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Map and geolocation applications on mobile devices
						can announce the names and descriptions of buildings
						and other location-related information.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Braille labels and descriptions on entrances, rooms,
						bathrooms, historical markers, and other points of interest
						can allow blind people to explore and understand their
						surroundings, as long as the person knows Braille, and as
						long as the Braille labels are easy to find.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Tactile models of the exterior of buildings, or of
						floorplans of the interior of buildings help blind people
						form a mental map of their surroundings.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Consumer & Industrial Products
						Blindness Challenge: Cannot see or feel
						the controls on flat interfaces on
						consumer devices such as microwaves,
						ovens, dishwashers, etc.</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Alternative interfaces with knobs or
						other tactile controls</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Audio interfaces</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Remote control through applications
						on mobile devices</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Consumer & Industrial Products
						Blindness Challenge: Cannot read the
						text on the containers or packaging for
						consumer items such as medicine,
						toothpaste, shampoo, sunscreen, hand
						cream, personal care products, foods,
						drinks, candy</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">Embossed Braille (or Braille stickers ) on
						packaging and product containers help
						consumers identify items both in the
						store and after purchase.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Consumer & Industrial Products
						Blindness Challenge: Cannot read
						money to determine its value</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Applications on mobile devices can photograph the
						money and read the value to blind people.
						Paper bills and coins could be manufactured in
						different sizes, shapes, or textures to allow blind
						people to distinguish the value based on touch.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Non-cache systems of payment can allow blind
						people to make financial transactions via computers,
						mobile devices, or on-site payment hardware with
						screen readers or self-voicing output.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Consumer & Industrial Products
							Blindness Challenge: Cannot read
							books, magazines, posters, postal mail,
							or other printed materials</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Optical character recognition software can convert
						scanned images of text into digital text readable by
						screen readers. The accuracy of the conversion
						depends on the quality of the original document, as
						well as font choices, line spacing, and the quality of
						the conversion software itself.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Information can be placed online or in other digital
						formats to allow blind people to read the materials
						using their own assistive technologies.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Low Vision</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-can see, but their vision is still quite far from perfect even with
						powerful corrective lenses</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-may be unable to see well enough to drive or read most printed
						text unless they enlarge it</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Not a single condition; It is a broad category encompassing many
						different conditions, with varying degrees of vision impairment</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-They can't see well enough to read small fonts or to clearly
						discern details without enlarging them.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">Possible types and characteristics:<br>
						Blur; Blur with Low Contrast; Cataracts; Diabetic Retinopathy;
						Glaucoma; Hemianopia; Macular Degeneration; Retinal
						Detachment</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Screen Magnification</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">shows a small portion of the screen at a time; it zooms in on a
						section of the screen and displays it at high resolution</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-there are still some issues a user can encounter. For instance, if
						an image is particularly large, a user may need to scroll around
						the screen to see the whole thing. If a JavaScript alert pops up
						to the side of the current visual focus, the alert may actually
						appear out of the visible area for the user with low vision, so
						the user may not see the alert at all. It is best to place popups,
						alerts, error messages, and other similar messages near the
						visual focus, to make sure users don't miss them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Color Customization</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-For people with low contrast vision, or low color vision, colors
						may not be easily visible, and may be hard to distinguish from each
						other. Text that is too close in color or luminance (brightness) to
						the background can be hard to read. Some people may also
						experience pain when looking at bright lights or bright areas on
						paper or computer screens. All-white backgrounds can be
						particularly difficult. To attempt to remedy the effects of low
						contrast and bright areas, users may modify the colors either in the
						operating system or in the web browser.</p>
						<p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left;">-Colors can be used in web design, but it is crucial to not use color
						alone to convey important information since users customize
						colors based on what is best for them. Make sure the important
						information is represented in the text. 18b</p>
